# React Heroku Workshop

Following along with a live workshop at nwHacks 2022, this project served as an introduction to React (Components, State, & Router), APIs, and deployment. 

The web application is a 'GitHub Issue Explorer', and allows the user to conveniently view issues currently on GitHub via a Search page and a Results page. Check out the website [here](https://react-heroku-workshop.herokuapp.com/)!

**Workshop Objectives & Learning Goals:**

- Be able to understand/modify existing React and JSX code.
- Be able to create and use new components.
- Be able to make an API call and use the response.
- Be able to deploy with Heroku.
